This question was pretty easy and I had thought of using two-pointers but the solution just sort of came along and it was simpler so I did it.

***Question: Given a list of integers nums, put all the zeros to the back of the list by modifying the list in-place. The relative ordering of other elements should stay the same.***

There's another solution I've uploaded (credits given) which looks much more cooler than mine. It uses a while loop though and I hate while loops 💆‍♀️
